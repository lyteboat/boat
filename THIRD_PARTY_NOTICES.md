Everything under `dsh/<group>/<package>` (the packages `dsh/kernel.json` lists) is imported from
https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness by `scripts/dist/import-upstream.ts`, at the tag
the most recent `Dist-Import` commit names (today dsh-v0.1.7-rc.1, commit 46a7f68b), and carries
boat's changes as commits on top; `src/boat/` and `tests/boat/` inside those packages are boat's
own. Files elsewhere marked "Adapted from deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness" (or "Modeled on") in their
